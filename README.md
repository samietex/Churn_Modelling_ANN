## Churn_Modelling_ANN
I built an Artificial Neural Network in predicting churn rate in a banking system. Keras, Scikit learn, Pandas, and Numpy libraries were used.
This repository also contain a documentation to show how the model can be used for real life case scenarios.

Here's an access to the project article: [Predicting Churn Rate in a Bank Using Artificial Neural Network with Keras](https://medium.com/@Samietex/predicting-churn-rate-in-a-bank-using-artificial-neural-network-with-keras-3bdc81e74f47)
