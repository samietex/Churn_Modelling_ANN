## Churn_Modelling_ANN

### Project Overview

The aim of this Churn Modeling project is to build prediction model that will predict if a customer will leave a bank or not. This stems from wether loans should be granted to a customer. 

Judging by this logic, if a customer will leave a bank, then loans shouldn't be granted to the customer and vice versa.


### Dataset Overview

For this project, I used a Kaggle dataset of bank customers containing their credit scores, location, gender, age, number of years spent in the bank, and amount of money left in their bank account, among other important details.


### Tasks

To achieve the objective of this project, I built an Artificial Neural Network using Python and the following Python libraries:

* ScikitLearn
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib.pyplot
* Keras

The Pandas library was used in reading the CSV format of the dataset and for also performing some data wrangling and cleaning practices.

The ScikitLearn library was used in various machine learning related tasks like splitting of the dataset, feature scaling of the dataset, and for describing the performance of the model. Since this project is focused on using Artificial Intelligence, I couldn't use the ScikitLearn library for building some other machine learning models.

The Numpy library was used in
